# Creating plan

Create a new plan in plans/*.md to resolve the `Plan` using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` to create the plan use the `Relevant Files` to focus on the right files.

## Instructions

- IMPORTANT: You're writing a plan to resolve a task based on the `Plan` that will add value to the application.
- IMPORTANT: The `Plan` describes the problem that will be resolved but remember we're not resolving the task, we're creating the plan that will be used to resolve the task based on the `Plan Format` below.
- You're writing a plan to resolve a task, it should be thorough and precise so we fix the root cause and prevent regressions.
- Create the plan in the `plans/*.md` file. Name it appropriately based on the `Plan`.
- Use the plan format below to create the plan. 
- Research the codebase to understand the task, reproduce it, and put together a plan to fix it.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every <placeholder> in the `Plan Format` with the requested value. Add as much detail as needed to fix the task.
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the task, its root cause, and the steps to fix it properly.
- IMPORTANT: For all phases that have high complexity must be split into sub-tasks that are low or medium complexity. High complexity tasks will have more tasks to work on, but not more than 5.
- IMPORTANT: Be surgical with your fix, solve the task at hand and don't fall off track.
- IMPORTANT: We want the minimal number of changes that will fix and address the task.
- Don't use decorators. Keep it simple.
- If you need a new library, use whatever bundler is prefered and be sure to report it in the `Notes` section of the `Plan Format`.
- Start your research by reading the `README.md` file.
