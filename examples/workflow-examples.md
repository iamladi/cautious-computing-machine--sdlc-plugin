## Tips for Effective Workflows

### Always Start with Understanding

1. Research the problem/solution space
2. Analyze existing code
3. Identify patterns and dependencies
4. Then plan

### Use the Right Agent for Each Step

- **codebase-locator**: Find files, functions, components
- **codebase-analyzer**: Understand how code works
- **codebase-pattern-finder**: Discover patterns and architecture
- **/research**: Learn best practices and solutions
- **/plan**: Create implementation roadmap
- **codex**: Automated refactoring and analysis

### Iterate and Verify

- Implement in phases
- Verify after each phase
- Use `/verify` to ensure quality
- Submit only when complete

### Document as You Go

- Save research findings
- Update plans based on learnings
- Document decisions and rationale
- Keep team informed with `/submit`
